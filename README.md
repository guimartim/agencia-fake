## 🧠 About the Project

This website simulates a **fictional digital agency** and was developed with the goal of practicing:

- Structuring with HTML5
- Styling with CSS3
- Organizing sections and navigation
- Clean and modern layout
- Visual interactivity using CSS

This project is part of my studies in **Systems Analysis and Development**.

## 💬 Project Highlights

- ✅ **Floating WhatsApp Button**  
  A WhatsApp icon is positioned in the corner of the screen with a direct link for customer contact. It simulates a quick support channel.

- ✅ **Interactive Cards with Hover Effect**  
  Service cards highlight on hover, with subtle changes in color, shadow, and scale. This improves the user experience with modern visual touches!
